 * SFML - This library provides most of the non-3d game engine needs like input handling and 2d graphics loading.
 * OpenGL32 - The OpenGl Library.
 * GLEW - A companion library that sets up your code to use the correct version of OpenGL
 * GLFW - Another helper library that helps set up GL in a window context
